## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can go to Issues and begin an issue with the Label Vulnerability, clearly stating where (code block) in which file (e.g., example.ns) it is found.
Please take the time to tell me how the Vulnerability is solvable, but this is not required. It would make me happy though :)

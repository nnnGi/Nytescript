This is an interpreted programming Language made in Python named Nytescript. It has essential functions such as
printing, input, conditional statements, definable functions, while and for loops, switch and try-except statements, and the ability to run files and

Nothing needs to be installed except the ```nytescript.py``` and ```shell.py``` file, preferably Python 3.12 and above.

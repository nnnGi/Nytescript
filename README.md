# Nytescript
![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-%3E=3.12-blue.svg) \
It is a simple, interpreted esoteric programming language (esolang) implemented in Python. It's designed to be an easy language to use and remember the syntax for.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* **Visual Studio Code (Preferably):** Used because there is an extension at [Nytescript on VSC Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nnnGitHub.nytescript)
* **Code Runner Extension (On VSCode)** So you can run your Nytescript Files from the Play Button (Only after running setup.py)
* **Python 3.12 or higher:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation
1.  Clone or download the Nytescript repository:
    ```zsh
    git clone [https://github.com/nnnGi/nytescript.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/nnnGi/nytescript.git)
    cd nytescript
    ```
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```zsh
	python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/MacOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
3. Run ```shell.py``` from Python without arguments for the shell, and provide the filename of a Nytescript (.ns) file that you want to run as an argument in the ```python shell.py example.ns``` format OR install the CLI from setup files provided and use the CLI universally with ```nytescript example.ns```

Notes: No libraries apart from the standard library are used

# Further Information
Nytescript Esolang, written by @\_nnn_ in Python 3.12.9 and 3.13.2 and 3.13.3	

It is based on the interpreter https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-myopl-code by David Callanan

This is an interpreted programming Language made in Python named Nytescript. It has essential functions such as
printing, input, conditional statements, definable functions, while and for loops, switch and try-except statements, and the ability to run files and 
exit the programme.

Nothing needs to be installed except the ```nytescript.py``` and ```shell.py``` file, preferably Python 3.12 and above.

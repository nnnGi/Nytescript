# üì• Patch Notes:
## Comments
- Removed '$' as a symbol for comments (foreshadowing)
## Types
- NoneType is now accessible to be returned by functions as the keyword ```None```
- ```TRUE``` is now ```True```
- ```FALSE``` is now ```False```
- ```NULL``` is now ```Null```
## Functions
- Added ```sorted()``` function with args ```iterable (String or List) and reverse (True or False)```
- Added ```is_in()``` function with args ```iterable (String or List) and item (Any Type)```
## Strings
- Made string reversable using ```'str'^-1``` for the reversed. For some reason I included ```'str'^1``` to be valid to keep the string exactly the same
